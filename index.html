        <p>Throughout my Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have grown from writing small, class-based assignments into developing fully structured, testable, and database-driven applications. My capstone project, the Rescue Animal Management System, reflects this progression by showcasing software engineering practices such as modular design, database integration, and automated testing, all built around a realistic organizational use case.</p>

        <p>The system was originally created in IT-145: Foundations in Application Development as a basic animal-shelter simulator. During the capstone, I transformed it into a professional-grade application with a complete Java Maven structure, SQLite database integration, object-oriented architecture, and JUnit testing. The program allows users to intake rescue animals, update their training status, reserve or unreserve animals, and view current records through an interactive console menu. Behind the scenes, the application uses a layered architecture featuring classes such as AnimalManager, DatabaseHelper, Validation, and subclasses like Dog and Monkey. These design choices make the project scalable, maintainable, and adaptable for future features such as graphical interfaces or web integration.</p>

        <p>This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement systems that emphasize data integrity, reliability, and testability. I implemented a Validation class to ensure proper user input, incorporated HashMaps for efficient lookups, and developed a FakeDatabaseHelper to support test-driven development. Each of these changes evolved from classroom learning into professional best practices. The transition from in-memory lists to SQLite storage especially deepened my understanding of relational data management and CRUD operations.</p>

        <p>Across my coursework, I strengthened my foundation in algorithms, data structures, and full-stack development. In CS-340, I connected back-end Flask APIs to MongoDB dashboards, while in CS-370, I explored reinforcement learning and AI behavior through Python-based environments. These experiences taught me to approach development from multiple perspectives, designing efficient logic, handling real-world data, and ensuring user-focused functionality.</p>

        <p>The capstone experience also reinforced the importance of version control and documentation. Using GitHub for commits, testing, and releases allowed me to manage my project as if it were a production repository. I documented each feature through the README, setup instructions, and structured project layout, mirroring industry standards for maintainability and collaboration.</p>

        <p>Looking ahead, I plan to pursue opportunities in software engineering and AI-assisted systems, where I can apply the same principles demonstrated in this project: problem solving, clean architecture, and iterative improvement. This ePortfolio represents not just a final deliverable but the culmination of a learning journey that prepared me to analyze problems, build reliable solutions, and adapt to evolving technologies.</p>

                    Artifact Description
                    The artifact I chose to enhance is the Rescue Animal System, a program I first worked on in IT 145. It is a command line application that lets userâ€™s intake animals, reserve them, and view them for service training. The original version worked but was pretty basic. For this enhancement I focused on making it stronger in terms of software design and user experience.

                        I picked this artifact because it really shows how far I have come as a developer. I reorganized the code, so it is easier to follow and added a Validation class that handles all input checks. This keeps AnimalManager focused on workflow instead of messy error handling. I also changed the way errors are handled. Instead of just sending users back to the menu when they make a mistake, the program now explains what a valid input looks like and asks them to try again. These updates highlight my ability to improve code quality, make it easier to maintain, and design for real users.
                    </p>

                        Back in Module One I planned to show my ability to use good software design techniques to improve an existing project. I think I met that goal here. By making validation modular and adding user feedback I used practices that are consistent with professional standards. I am also setting up JUnit testing for the validation rules, which helps prove the program works as intended. So far, my plan for covering the outcomes is still on track and I will keep expanding on it with testing and documentation.
                    </p>

                        Working on this enhancement taught me how useful it is to separate logic into different classes. Having all the rules in one place makes the system easier to manage and change later. I also saw how much better the program feels when you think about the user experience instead of just making it technically work. The hardest part was figuring out how strict to make the validation without making it annoying for the user. I had to balance clear rules with flexibility. Overall, this was a good learning process that made the code cleaner and closer to what I would expect in a real software project.

                    Artifact Description
                    The artifact I chose to enhance is the Rescue Animal System, originally developed in IT 145 and expanded in later courses. It began as a simple command-line program for intaking, reserving, and viewing animals in training. For this milestone, I focused on the algorithms and data structures within the program by restructuring it to use HashMaps instead of arrays. This change made searching, adding, and removing animals more efficient by allowing direct lookups through unique IDs.

                        This artifact demonstrates my ability to apply appropriate data structures to real problems. Moving from arrays to HashMaps improved performance and scalability as the system grew. I also refined filtering and searching logic with Java streams to improve readability. These changes highlight my ability to balance efficiency and maintainability while choosing the right tools for the task.

                        This enhancement aligns with my plan to demonstrate algorithmic principles and the use of efficient data structures. Replacing arrays with HashMaps reduced lookup complexity, and streams made filtering easier to read while still effective. The improvements show progress toward the outcome of designing and evaluating computing solutions that apply data structure and algorithm knowledge.

                        Through this enhancement, I learned how much impact the right data structure has on performance and scalability. Arrays were functional in the original version but inefficient for larger datasets. Using HashMaps allowed faster lookups and cleaner management. A challenge I faced was keeping unique IDs consistent, which I solved by resetting the counter based on the highest existing ID. Overall, the process reinforced the importance of designing with growth in mind and gave me valuable practice applying data structures in a professional way.

It began as a simple command-line program for intaking, reserving, and viewing animals in training. For this milestone, I integrated an SQLite database to persist animal records beyond program runtime. I created a DatabaseConnector and CRUD operations for interacting with the database, while still using HashMaps and in-memory storage for testing. This setup allowed me to keep testing fast and controlled while making the production system more realistic and reliable.

Keeping HashMaps for in-memory testing while adding a persistent database shows my ability to adapt solutions to different environments. This demonstrates my skills in both software design and database management.

                        Through this enhancement, I learned the importance of combining persistence with testability. It was challenging to ensure consistency between the in-memory storage and the database, but using a layered approach helped. I also had to refine validation so invalid data would not enter either storage system. Overall, I gained valuable experience in integrating databases into an existing system while still maintaining fast and reliable testing workflows.
